# Advanced Controls for Maximizing Wind Turbine Power Coefficient (MATLAB/Simulink)

## Programming Platform:
* MATLAB/Simulink

## Files included:
* Published Paper
* Presentation Slides
* MATLAB Code

## Code
The code was written in Python. To run the code you need to download the data file from Kaggle. Then download the Data Preprocessing file and change the path name under the “Import Data File” section to "accepted_2007_to2018Q4.csv". Then you can run this file. It will export a new data file called “Accepted.csv” which is the clean and organized dataset. Now you can run the other two python files. Again change the file name in the “Import Data File” section. Then you should be able to run both files. Exploratory Analysis will run very quickly, but the Machine Learning Algorithms take a long time to run.
